Eric the Half a Bee
###################

A one... two-- A one... two... three... four...::

   Half a bee, philosophically,
   Must, ipso facto, half not be.
   But half the bee has got to be
   Vis a vis, its entity. D'you see?

   But can a bee be said to be
   Or not to be an entire bee
   When half the bee is not a bee
   Due to some ancient injury?

   Singing...

   La dee dee, one two three,
   Eric the half a bee.
   A B C D E F G,
   Eric the half a bee.

   Is this wretched demi-bee,
   Half-asleep upon my knee,
   Some freak from a menagerie?
   No! It's Eric the half a bee!

   Fiddle de dum, Fiddle de dee,
   Eric the half a bee.
   Ho ho ho, tee hee hee,
   Eric the half a bee.

   I love this hive, employee-ee,
   Bisected accidentally,
   One summer afternoon by me,
   I love him carnally.

   He loves him carnally,
   Semi-carnally.
   The end.

   Cyril Connelly?
   No; semi-carnally!
   Oh.

   Cyril Connelly.
